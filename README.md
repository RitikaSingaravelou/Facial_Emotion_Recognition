# Facial_Emotion_Recognition

The aim of this project is to classify images of human faces into one of the seven basic emotions - happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, neutral using an ANN based model
[this work was later included as a module in the mental health monitoring system I developed]
